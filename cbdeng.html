                                The cannabinoid CBD is a non-psychoactive isomer of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), its
                                The most growing available form is CBD oil. By not having psychoactive activity
                                offered as a totally safe asset. On a practical level, CBD hemp oil
                                we could say that it is nothing more than a concentrated solvent extract composed of flowers or
                                cannabis leaves that are dissolved in a vegetable oil such as sunflower oil, hemp oil
                                or olive oil. The solvents used for its extraction can vary from
                                relatively harmless organic solvents, such as ethanol or isopropyl alcohol,
                                others more toxic such as petroleum ether. Its extraction can also be done with
                                supercritical fluids such as butane or CO2. The exact conditions and solvents
                                applied for its manufacture have a great impact on, for example, the taste, the color
                                and the viscosity of the final product. Because many other components of the plant
                                are extracted together with the desired cannabinoids, sometimes these must be
                                eliminated, in order to obtain a purer final product. Its use is
                                mainly therapeutic, both oral and topical.
                                Remembering what our tutor María José Gea explained to us about CBD, we know that
                                In Europe, the cultivation of the hemp variety of Cannabis sativa is allowed as long as
                                when the THC concentration does not exceed 2%. On this basis, in the Convention
                                Single Law on Narcotic Drugs (signed in New York on March 30, 1961) is considered
                                narcotic the resins, the extracts and the tincture of the Cannabis. In Annex II of the
                                Regulation (EC) 1223/2009, which lists the substances whose use is prohibited
                                narcotics (entry 306) appear as prohibited substances. Therefore, the
                                cannabis, its resin, extracts and tinctures could not be used in cosmetics. Nevertheless,
                                are excluded from the classification as narcotic drugs the seeds and leaves of
                                hemp, which do not contain cannabidiol. In order to use it as a cosmetic ingredient,
                                what the industry has done is obtain it synthetically, this is a way of
                                ensure that the ingredient complies with current legislation.
