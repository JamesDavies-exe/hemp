                                The use of hemp derivatives for cosmetic formulation dates back to
                                ancient of history. It is known, for example, that in ancient China the preparations
                                Cannabis topicals were used externally to treat skin rashes,
                                ulcers, wounds and for alopecia. There is also archaeological evidence indicating
                                that topical cannabis preparations were used by the Egyptians to treat
                                eye problems and for wound dressing. The medieval Arabs applied their
                                leaves to improve some skin conditions such as pityriasis and lichen planus.
                                In more modern times, already in the 20th century, and before the prohibition of its
                                marketing, cannabis tinctures were frequently sold at any
                                pharmacy for the treatment of calluses, irritable bladder and pain
                                menstrual. Thus, we can verify that the therapeutic potential of this plant
                                offers a wide range of possibilities.
                                To better understand the process by which cannabis derivatives
                                can act on the skin, it must be understood that it has receptors for substances
                                endocannabinoids that our own body synthesizes in what makes up a system
                                endocannabinoid (internally synthesized), which is involved in such complex systems
                                such as the development of the epidermis and its appendages (hair and nails). This system
                                endocannabinoid is also involved in cell survival, in responses
                                immune and inflammatory, in the synthesis of dermal lipids or in the transmission of
                                Sensory stimuli to the Central Nervous System (CNS).
                                Numerous clinical studies are currently being carried out where there is still
                                reveals the potential use of cannabis and its derivatives as ingredients
                                essential in the treatment of some dermal imbalances such as
                                atopic dermatitis, scleroderma or psoriasis. This has made some assets
                                such as cannabidiol, abbreviated as CBD, has become fashionable in preparations
                                cosmetics, and especially in natural cosmetic products. on our blog
                                you can find a very complete post about CBD where a deep analysis of the
                                situation is active in natural cosmetics, I invite you to visit it. next we go
                                to see some raw materials derived from hemp that have been integrated into the
                                natural cosmetics. We will see its main characteristics and its use in
                                natural cosmetics.
